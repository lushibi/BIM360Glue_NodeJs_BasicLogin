# BIM360Glue_NodeJs_BasicLogin
Very basic example on how to use node.js to login to Autodesk BIM 360 Glue.

Based on Node.js and using [expressjs generator](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) to generate the code from scratch. You may need to know a little bit about [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) which is a HTML template engine for Node.js, however, you can use raw HTML files too.

## Run:

* clone the repository
* `cd <YourCodeDirectory> && npm install`
* copy credentials_.js and rename to credentials.js
* open credentials.js, change api_key, api_secret and company_id to your own.
* `node bin\www`
* browse to `http://localhost:3000`
